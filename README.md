# NarrativeSphereAI

A dynamic narrative generation system for AI-driven games, focusing on dramatic tension, conflict, and abstract world representation.

## Overview
NarrativeSphereAI is an experimental project creating emergent narratives through simulated agent interactions in a directed graph ecosystem. Unlike traditional simulations that focus on concrete geographical locations, we prioritize abstract representations to enhance dramatic potential. This framework serves as a backend for AI-native games, enabling dynamic story generation and character relationships.

### Key Features
- Graph-based narrative structure using networkx
- Agent-driven story evolution, emphasizing dramatic arcs
- Dynamic relationship mapping
- Emergent storytelling mechanics
- AI-native game integration capabilities

### Core Philosophy

We differentiate ourselves by focusing on:

- **Dramatic Tension and Conflict:** Our primary focus is on generating compelling narratives driven by dramatic tension and character conflict.
- **Abstract World Representation:** We abstract away from specific geographical locations, allowing for more flexible and impactful storytelling.
- **Counteracting the "Active Nihilism" of Everyday Life:** Games and narratives should combat the inherent fragmentation of human experience by providing engaging and meaningful experiences. We draw inspiration from the common origins of games and festivals in this regard (曾童心).
- **Leveraging LLM Token Representation:** Recognizing that LLMs can't fully capture game mechanics through natural language alone, we aim to utilize the abstract token representation of LLMs to create multi-layered game representations.
- **Synthetic Catallaxy:** We embrace the idea that game experience arises from the collision and coordination of the player's mental model and the game's world model, a concept Benjamin Bratton terms "synthetic catallaxy." We focus on synthetic (generated through non-mechanistic understanding) rather than artificial (simulating appearance) intelligence.
