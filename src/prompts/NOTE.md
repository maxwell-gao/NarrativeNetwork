# Morphology of the Folktale: Research Background and Analysis

## I. Research Background, Methods and Materials

### 1. Research Purpose
- Before studying "the origin of stories", we need to understand "what is a story"

### 2. Definition of "Magic Tales"
- Magic tales are narratives built on ordered alternation of functional elements
- May have omissions and repetitions 
- "Magic" here doesn't refer to fantasy but is retained due to lack of better terminology

### 3. Impact of Aarne-Thompson Classification
- Shifted from "classification" to "description"
- Found motifs can be further subdivided beyond logical units

### 4. Necessity of Formal Analysis 
- Structural study of all story types is prerequisite for historical research
- Formal patterns precede historical patterns

### 5. Materials
- 100 stories from Aarne-Thompson catalog numbers 300-749

## II. Functions of Characters

### Key Observations
1. Character names and attributes vary but actions/functions remain constant
2. Functions serve as stable story elements regardless of performer
3. Number of functions is limited
4. Function sequence remains consistent
5. All magic tales follow same structural type

### The 31 Functions
1. Absentation - Family member leaves home
2. Interdiction - Hero receives warning or command
3. Violation - Warning or command is violated
4. Reconnaissance - Villain gathers information
5. Delivery - Villain gains information about victim
6. Trickery - Villain attempts to deceive victim
7. Complicity - Victim is deceived by villain
8. Villainy/Lack - Villain causes harm or something is missing
9. Mediation - Hero learns of villainy/lack
10. Beginning counteraction - Hero decides to act
11. Departure - Hero leaves home
12. First Function of Donor - Hero is tested
13. Hero's Reaction - Hero responds to test
14. Receipt of Magical Agent - Hero gains magical item/power
15. Guidance - Hero is led to objective
16. Struggle - Hero and villain fight
17. Branding - Hero is marked
18. Victory - Villain is defeated
19. Liquidation - Initial misfortune resolved
20. Return - Hero heads home
21. Pursuit - Hero is chased
22. Rescue - Hero escapes pursuit
23. Unrecognized Arrival - Hero arrives unrecognized
24. Unfounded Claims - False hero makes claims
25. Difficult Task - Hero faces challenge
26. Solution - Hero completes challenge
27. Recognition - Hero is recognized
28. Exposure - False hero/villain exposed
29. Transfiguration - Hero gets new appearance
30. Punishment - Villain is punished
31. Wedding - Hero marries/rewarded


## III. Forms of Assimilation

### Function Combinations
- Single functions performed multiple ways
- Functions influencing each other
- Forms transferring between functions

## IV. Auxiliary Elements

### 1. Information Flow
- Connects non-sequential functions
- Enables character knowledge transfer

### 2. Trebling
- Can apply to details, functions, or whole sequences
- May be uniform, increasing, or mixed results

### 3. Motivations
- Required for initial villainy
- Lack serves as alternative motivation

## V. Distribution of Functions

### 1. Distribution by Story Type
- Functions distributed differently across story types
- Some functions more common in certain types

### 2. Distribution by Geography
- Geographic variations in function distribution
- Cultural influences on function prevalence

## VI. Sequence of Functions

### 1. Fixed Sequences
- Certain functions always follow specific sequences
- Sequence consistency across different stories

### 2. Variable Sequences
- Some functions have flexible order
- Variability influenced by story context

## VII. Character Roles

### 1. Role Types

#### The Villain
- Fights against the hero
- Creates conflict through harmful actions
- Disrupts peace or causes misfortune

#### The Donor (Provider)
- Tests the hero
- Provides magical objects or assistance
- Prepares hero for main challenge

#### The Helper
- Assists hero in completing tasks
- Provides physical or practical aid
- Often appears after donor's test

#### The Princess and Father
- Princess serves as story goal/reward
- Sets difficult tasks for hero
- Father often assigns tasks or sanctions marriage

#### The Dispatcher
- Sends hero on quest
- Identifies problem or lack
- Initiates hero's journey

#### The Hero
- Reacts to donor's tests
- Undertakes journey or quest
- Resolves initial misfortune

#### The False Hero
- Makes unfounded claims
- Attempts to take hero's place
- Exposed in final stages- Hero, Villain, Donor, Helper, Princess, Dispatcher, False Hero
- Roles defined by functions performed

### 2. Role Dynamics
- Characters may switch roles
- Role changes driven by function requirements

## VIII. Spheres of Action

### 1. Villain's Sphere
- Performs villainy (A)
- Fights/struggles with hero (H)
- Pursues hero (Pr)

### 2. Donor's Sphere
- Prepares magical agent transfer (D)
- Provides magical agent to hero (F)

### 3. Helper's Sphere
- Transfers hero through space (G)
- Liquidates misfortune/lack (K)
- Rescues from pursuit (Rs)
- Solves difficult tasks (N)
- Transfigures hero (T)

### 4. Princess/Father Sphere
- Assigns difficult tasks (M)
- Brands hero (J)
- Exposes false hero (Ex)
- Recognizes true hero (Q)
- Punishes second villain (U)
- Participates in marriage (W)
Note: Princess and father roles often overlap, with father typically assigning tasks due to hostility toward suitor

### 5. Dispatcher's Sphere
- Dispatches hero (connective incident, B)

### 6. Hero's Sphere
- Departs on search (C↑)
- Reacts to donor's demands (E)
- Participates in wedding (W*)
Note: Seeker-hero performs all functions; victim-hero only latter two

### 7. False Hero's Sphere
- Departs on search (C↑)
- Reacts to donor (E)
- Makes unfounded claims (L)

## IX. Conclusion

- Recap of key observations and analyses
- Importance of function-based analysis

### 2. Implications for Future Research
- Potential areas for further study
- Impact on understanding of narrative structures
